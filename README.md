# Burgers Restaurant Menu MVP

Welcome to the Burgers Restaurant Menu project, a React-based MVP designed to showcase the core functionalities of what promises to be a comprehensive restaurant application. This early version demonstrates essential features, serving as a foundation for future expansion into a full-fledged restaurant management and menu display solution.

## üöÄ Overview

This project offers a glimpse into a potential future application for restaurants, focusing on user interactions with the menu. You can browse items, view details, and customize your order by adding and removing items from the basket. While the current iteration emphasizes basic functionality, its architecture is poised for growth, anticipating more complex features like finalizing purchases, user profiles, and advanced customization.

To ensure reliability and cater to a global audience, we've integrated unit tests using the React Testing Library and implemented comprehensive internationalization for texts, times/dates, and money formats. These enhancements not only improve the application's quality and user experience but also lay a solid foundation for scaling to different markets and user preferences.

In an effort to maximize accessibility, the application has been deployed to an AWS S3 bucket, ensuring high availability and scalability. Additionally, the design is fully responsive, paving the way for this MVP to evolve into a Progressive Web App (PWA). This transformation would allow users on any mobile device to enjoy an app-like experience without the need to download a traditional application from an app store.
